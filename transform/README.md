# API Documentation for Transactional Transform Method

## Overview

This document describes the API method for performing a transactional transform using the Upgini endpoint. This endpoint is used to apply transformations based on previously trained features using the FeaturesEnricher model.

## Authentication

To access the endpoint, an API_KEY is required. This key must be the same one used during the training of the FeaturesEnricher.

## Request

The request to the http_inference_trigger endpoint is made using the HTTP POST method. Below is a template for the request using curl:

## Example of request:
```bash
curl "https://search.upgini.com/test/api/http_inference_trigger?search_id=<put search identifier here>" \
    -H "Authorization: <put API_KEY here>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"search_keys": {"COUNTRY": "GB", "DATE": "2020-01-01", "POSTAL_CODE": "111111"}, "features": {"feature1": "featureValue1", "feature2": "featureValue2}}'
```

## Parameters

* `Authorization`: (Header) The API key (without Bearer).
* `Content-Type`: (Header) Set this to application/json to indicate the type of data being sent.
* `search_id`: (Request param) This is the identifier obtained after initiating the training of the FeaturesEnricher. It should be replaced with the actual search identifier.
* `search_keys`: (Body) A dictionary where the keys are the types of search keys used during fit, and the values are the specific values for these keys that you want to transform.
* `features`: (Body) If features were used during fit to generate new features, they must be specified here with their corresponding values.

## Response

The API response will include the transformed features based on the input data.

Example of successful response:

```json
{
    "status": "ok", 
    "result": {
        "f_enriched_feature1": 18.0,
        "f_autofe_mul_sd8f7s9": 234.4,
        "f_enriched_cat_feature2": "test",
        "f_empty_feature3": null,
        "feature1_bd1088_emb1208": -0.007415670435875654,
        "feature1_bd1088_emb775": 0.03687792643904686,
        "feature2_bd1088_emb99": -0.01887989602982998,
        "feature2_bd1088_emb1172": -0.04251651093363762
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

In case of errors, the API will return appropriate HTTP status codes along with descriptive error messages to help diagnose issues.

Example of failed response:
```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "errorMessage": "Detailed message"
}
```

## Best Practices

Ensure the API_KEY is kept secure and not exposed in client-side code.
Validate inputs before sending to prevent errors related to data format.
Use HTTPS to ensure the security of data in transit.
